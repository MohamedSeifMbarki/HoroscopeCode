# The HoroscopeCode üåå

This project is my response to a task assigned by **Ad√©o**. It is a lightweight and secure horoscope application built with **Node.js** and the **Express** framework. The app provides the zodiac sign corresponding to a given birthdate, leveraging the **horoscope** library.

Additionally, the project follows best practices, including the **Factory Pattern**, to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. A Dockerfile is included for easy containerization, and GitHub Actions are set up to automate the Docker image build process.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Query Zodiac Signs**: Input a birthdate (YYYY-MM-DD) to get the corresponding zodiac sign.
- **Factory Pattern**: Encapsulation of logic using a dedicated factory for creating services.
- **Security**: Implemented `helmet` for HTTP headers and `rateLimit` for rate limiting.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized for seamless deployment.
- **Automated CI**: GitHub Actions workflow to build and push the Docker image.

## Docker üê≥

### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t horoscope-code .
```

### Run the Container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 horoscope-code
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## GitHub Actions ‚öôÔ∏è

The project includes a **GitHub Actions** workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`) that automates the Docker image build and push process.

### Workflow Details:

1. Triggers on pushes to the `main` branch.
2. Builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.
3. Pushes the image to Docker Hub.

To use this workflow, configure the following repository secrets:

- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password.

## Tests üß¨

The application includes comprehensive tests using **Jest**. Tests validate the API responses for various scenarios (valid dates, invalid dates, and missing query parameters).

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```
